# Double-Linked-List-For-Embedded-SW
Double linked list implementation for embedded SW

Description:
The use of dynamic memory allocation is not recommended in embedded SW, so this implementation
uses static memory allocation of all the available list items.

The double linked list is encapsulated in a static library.

An example application which implements a team member directory is included to provide an example
of how the double linked list can be used.
